Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game
This project is a Python implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, a variation of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game, which includes two additional options: Lizard and Spock. The game was popularized by the TV show The Big Bang Theory.

How to Play
The game works by having the user choose between five possible options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The computer will randomly select one of these options as well, and the winner will be determined according to the following rules:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Each game consists of a single round, and the outcome will be displayed as either a win, lose, or draw.
